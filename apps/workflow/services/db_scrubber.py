"""
Scrubs a restored copy of prod (in the `scrub` DB alias) of all PII.

Reproduces three behaviours from the legacy backport_data_backup command:
  1. Anonymise the columns in PII_CONFIG (+ _anonymize_staff).
  2. Delete the unlinked accounting records that _filter_unlinked_accounting_records dropped.
  3. Truncate the tables in EXCLUDE_MODELS (minus framework tables).

Anything beyond that is OUT OF SCOPE for this task and must NOT be added without
a separate ticket — see docs/plans/2026-04-25-pg-dump-backport-refresh-plan.md
"Strict like-for-like contract".

Safety: refuses to run unless settings.DATABASES["scrub"]["NAME"] ends in
"_scrub" — last line of defence against a misconfigured SCRUB_DB_NAME pointing
at prod.
